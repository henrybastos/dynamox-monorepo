This document aims to explain my line of thought throughout the planning, development and testing of the project. The steps, methods, tools and strategies chosen for the project full lifecycle.

# 1. Project Overview

I noted all the requirements in a document, organized in basically three sections: Overview, Server Side and Client Side. 

**Overview**: All the business logic, features and general requirements.

**Server Side:** All the front-end requirements (tech stack, UI/UX, views, auth session etc)

**Client Side:** All the back-end requirements (technical requirements, tech stack, API routes, sensors simulation etc)

# 2. Implementation Plan

With all the requirements defined, I've moved on to making an implementation plan, with major phases and tasks. The main plan was to use the approach of Spec-Driven Development, where you first create one or multiple documents with all the neutralrmation about the project achitecture, rules and features, so then it gets fed to the AI to do the "heavy lifting". It presents the advantages of AI development, which is much more quicker, and the usage of well built documents for a much better output quality and less allucinations and unexpected results.
