# The Project

I need a project for registering machines and monitoring points. the machines can be motors, fans, pumps, compressors, gearboxes, rollers, harversters, overhead cranes, yard equipment, wind turbines and bearings, each with unique characteristics and properties. As for the sensors, we have three: TcAg, TcAs and HF+. 

# Glossary

## General

**Machines:** Any type of equipment which properties and performance can be monitored by any Sensor.

# Oficial Requirements

## 1 - Authentication

- As a user, I want to log in using a fixed email and password so that I can access private routes.
- As a user, I want to be able to log out of the system so that I can prevent unauthorized access to my account.
- No private routes should be accessible without authentication.

## 2 - Machine Management

- As a user, I want to create a new machine with an arbitrary name and with a type selected from a list ["Pump", "Fan"] so that I can manage it later.
- As a user, I want to change the attributes (name and type) of a machine after creating it so that I can keep the machine information updated.
- As a user, I want to delete a machine when it is no longer in use so that it doesn't clutter the system.

## 3 - Monitoring Points and Sensors Management

- As a user, I want to create at least two monitoring points with arbitrary names for an existing machine, so that I can monitor the machine's performance.
- As a user, I want to associate a sensor to an existing monitoring point so that I can monitor the machine's performance. The sensor should have a unique ID, and the sensor model name should be one of ["TcAg", "TcAs", "HF+"].
- As a user, I want the system to prevent me from setting up "TcAg" and "TcAs" sensors for machines of the type "Pump".
- As a user, I want to see all my monitoring points in a paginated list so that I can manage them. The list should display up to 5 monitoring points per page and should include the following information: "Machine Name", "Machine Type", "Monitoring Point Name", and "Sensor Model".
- As a user, I want to sort the monitoring points list by any of its columns in ascending or descending order, so that I can easily find the information I'm looking for.

## 4 - Ambiguity Handling

- Make reasonable assumptions and design the application accordingly for any ambiguities in the challenge.
- Document your assumptions in the README file.

## 5 - Technical requirements

- Use TypeScript.
- Use React.
- Use Redux for managing global states.
- Use Redux Thunks or Redux Saga for managing asynchronous side effects.
- Use Next.js or Vite.
- Use Material UI 5 for styling the application.
- Create reusable components.
- The code is well-organized and documented.
- The application layout is responsive.
- Ensure correct business logic and behavior with automated unit tests.

## 6 - Back-end Requirements

- Implement your own back-end code using NodeJS JavaScript runtime (not Java, not PHP...). Although we also work with Python here, we are looking for JavaScript related skills in this test.
- Use either PostgreSQL or MongoDB as a persistence layer.
- If you choose to use PostgreSQL, use Prisma ORM (or even try Drizzle, or Kysely) to interact with PostgreSQL.
- If you choose to use MongoDB, use Mongoose ORM to interact with the database.
- Implement RESTful API endpoints for all required functionality (authentication, machine management, sensor management).
- Implement time-series data storage and retrieval functionality for sensor data.
- Ensure the API has proper error handling and validation.
- Implement unit tests for backend code.
- The latency between client and the server side should be below 350ms for all requests.

## 7 - Time-Series Data Management

- As a user, I want to be able to store raw sensor data as time-series for my monitoring points.
- As a user, I want to be able to retrieve metrics about the time-series data for my sensors.
- As a user, I want to be able to delete time-series data I've sent to the server.
- As a user, I want to be able to retrieve the number of time-series I've stored in the server.
- As a user, I want to be able to retrieve a full time-series I've stored.
- As a user, I want to be able to visualize time-series data in a chart or graph format.

## 8 - Bonus

- Use Nx to manage the whole application as a monorepo (we use that tool a lot here).
- Add e2e tests with Cypress (use it to test a full user flow).
- If you were provided with a baseline code, identify any areas of bad code or suboptimal implementations and refactor them.
- Deploy your application to a cloud provider and provide a link for the running app.
- Implement a functionality that gives a future prediction of the time-series data.
- Add load balancer to the application.
- Add load tests to the application.

## 9 - Tips

- There is no need to reinvent the wheel. You can use a Material UI 5 free template like [Devias Kit](https://mui.com/store/items/devias-kit/) to speed up the development process.
- Not familiar with Redux? Check out [this tutorial](https://egghead.io/courses/modern-redux-with-redux-toolkit-rtk-and-typescript-64f243c8) to get started.
- Not familiar with Cypress? Check out [these tutorials](https://learn.cypress.io/) to get started.
- For time-series data visualization, consider using libraries like [Recharts](https://recharts.org/), [Chart.js](https://www.chartjs.org/), or [D3.js](https://d3js.org/).
